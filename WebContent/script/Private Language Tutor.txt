Nick: Well, I'm here to talk to her . . .
The Big Sister: I know why you here.
Nick: Good. Uh, Is Sarah here?
The Big Sister: Um, I first have a couple of questions, and??<a href="https://esl-lab.com/privatetutor/privatetutor-sc1.htm#key">you [had] better</a>answer them. First of all, what is your name?
Nick: Uh, my name? I'm Nick . . .

Nick: Um. I'm from Brownsville. Why are you asking me . . .
The Big Sister: Okay. How old are you?
Nick: What!?
The Big Sister: How old are you?
Nick:??<a href="https://esl-lab.com/privatetutor/privatetutor-sc1.htm#key">Does that matter?</a>
The Big Sister: Of course, it matters. I wouldn't be asking otherwise.
Nick: Really?
The Big Sister: Really. Yeah. Sarah's only 19.
Nick: Okay, I'm 22. Now, is Sarah here?
The Big Sister: Where did you first meet Sarah and why do you like her so much?
Nick: Like her? What do you mean? I've only met her??<a href="https://esl-lab.com/privatetutor/privatetutor-sc1.htm#key">once</a>? in . . .
The Big Sister: Don't??<a href="https://esl-lab.com/privatetutor/privatetutor-sc1.htm#key">lie</a>? to me, Nick.
Nick: Are you sure you have the right??<a href="https://esl-lab.com/privatetutor/privatetutor-sc1.htm#key">guy</a>? Listen. Are you sure? [<i>I'm sure, I'm sure.</i>] Listen. I'm leaving. I don't need the money THAT much.
The Big Sister: Money? Wait! What do you mean?
Nick: Listen. I'm a teaching assistant at the university, and I met Sarah in the Spanish class last week. She asked me if I could teach her, you know, help her with her class.
The Big Sister: So, you're not Nick Roberts, that guy that drives that crazy motorcycle? [<i>No!</i>] The one with the large tattoo of a large snake across his back?
Nick: No! What? You've got the wrong guy. I'm leaving. This??<a href="https://esl-lab.com/privatetutor/privatetutor-sc1.htm#key">whole</a>? thing is crazy.
