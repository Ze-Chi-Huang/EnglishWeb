Heather: Hey. John. This looks a great party. [<i>Yeah!</i>] Thanks for inviting me.
John: No problem. Glad you could make it. Hey. Have you met any of the??famous? guests??so far?
Heather: Uh, no. Who??exactly?
John: Well, there is Gregorio Zuttlemisterburger . . . [<i>Who?</i>]. Ah. They call him the "Grip" for short.
Heather: Who in the world is he?
John: You've never heard of him? [<i>No</i>.] He's the world famous snake trainer . . . He's never met a snake he couldn't train to dance and hiss at the same time.
Heather: Seriously? Where is he?
John: Uh, he's the tall guy over there in the purple jacket and green pants. He probably has a snake or two with him tonight.
Heather: Huh?
John: And then there is Georgina, the Great.
Heather: Georgina . . . and great for what?
John: Are you serious? You've never heard of her? She is the world's greatest arm wrestler. I mean, World champion. She's the??petite??woman next to the fireplace with the bright yellow dress and the tennis shoes.
Heather: I thought you said famous people . . . like, like people we all know.
John: And, and there is Brad Pitt . . .
Heather: Now, there's someone I recognize . . .
John: . . . the captain of the national Yo-Yo team [<i>What?</i>]. Yeah. He's the short,??stocky? man sitting at the table wearing the black and red checkered shirt. I'm sure he'd do a few tricks for you if you asked.
Heather: Uh, no thank you. I think I've had enough entertainment for one evening.
John: Okay.
