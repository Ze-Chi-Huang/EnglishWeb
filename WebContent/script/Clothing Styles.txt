Ashley: Hey, Jake. Are you ready for your trip?
Jake: Well, not really. I still have to buy some clothes.
Ashley: Well, what's the weather like where you're going?
Jake: Well, uh, it's really hot in the summer, so I'm going to buy some shorts, sandals, and a few t-shirts.
Ashley: What about the??rest??of the year?
Jake: People say that the fall can still be warm until November, so I'm going to buy some jeans and a few casual shirts.
Ashley: Will you need any warm clothes for the winter?
Jake: Well, the weather doesn't get too cold, but it often snows in the mountains, so I'm going to buy a couple of warm sweaters, a jacket, and a hat. I don't have??room?말n my suitcase to??pack??a coat, so I'm going to wait until I get there and buy it when I really need it.
Ashley: Are you going to take anything else?
Jake: They say it??rains cats and dogs?말n the spring, but again, I'll probably just wait and??pick up?마 raincoat or an umbrella later on. But, I'm going to take a good pair of shoes because I plan on walking to and from school everyday.
Ashley: Do you need any clothing for??formal occasions?
Jake: Well, you never know when you might need something?맖n the spur of the moment?맍or a wedding or maybe someone's graduation, or a nice date, so I'll probably take some nice??slacks, a dress shirt, and a couple (of) crazy ties or two.
Ashley: Um, that??makes sense.
Jake: And I'll just rent a suit or tuxedo if I need anything more formal. Hey, maybe I'll get married.
Ashley: You? Married? Hah!
Jake: Wait. What are you trying to say?
Ashley: I just can't imagine you??decked out?말n a tuxedo for any formal occasion. [<i>What?!</i>] I mean, for high school graduation, you wore an old pair of jeans and tennis shoes.
Jake: Hey, there was a reason for that, so let me explain. [<i>Yeah, ha, ha.</i>] No, really. You see, it goes like this . . .
