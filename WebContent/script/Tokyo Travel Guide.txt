Man: Let me see now. Which train do I need to get on?
Woman: Excuse me. Do you need any help?
Man: Yes, I want to go to Tokyo Tower, but I'm really lost. This is my first visit to Japan, so I have no idea on how to ride the trains.
Woman: First, you need to buy a ticket to your??destination. [<em>Um-HUH</em>] From here, it's a hundred and thirty yen.
Man: A hundred thirty yen. Okay.
Woman: Then, get on the Hibiya Subway Line at??platform??number 4.
Man: Number 4, alright. Oh, and how often do the trains come around this time of day?
Woman: Usually, they come about every six minutes or so.
Man: Alright. And where do I get off the train?
Woman: Get off at Kamiyacho Station, three stops from here. The sign at the station is written in English, so you'll be able to read it.
Man: Three stops. Got it. Thanks for your help.
Woman: No problem. Good luck.
