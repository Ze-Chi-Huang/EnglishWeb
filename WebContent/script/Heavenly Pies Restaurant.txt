Waiter: Oh, I'm so sorry, but we aren't serving pies today.
Man: Huh? I thought this was Heavenly Pies Restaurant.
Waiter: Well, it usually is, but, Dave, our baker, slipped in the kitchen on a banana two days ago, and??hurt??his leg. [<i>Oh</i>] He'll be out for at least two weeks. In the meantime, we're serving ice cream sundaes instead. Sorry.
Man: Wow. I'm sorry to hear that. Well in that case, I'll have an ice cream sundae.
Woman: I'll be back with your order in a few minutes
