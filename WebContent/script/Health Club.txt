Justin: Uh, hi. Do you need some help with those??weights? I can move them for you.
Rachel: Uh, no. I can do it myself. I just have to put them back over there.
Justin: No, let me help you. Uh, Oh, Hmpf.
Rachel: Oh, it's okay.
Justin: Oh, my back!
Rachel: It's okay, it's okay. Are you okay?
Justin: I just need to lie down here. Uh. Do you come here often?
Rachel: Yeah. I usually come five times a week.
Justin: Oh, oh man. By the way, my name's Justin.
Rachel: I'm Rachel.
Justin: Uh, so, where are you from?
Rachel: I'm??originally??from California . . . Are you sure you're okay?
Justin: (<i>Said in??agony</i>) Yeah, um, I'm okay. Where are you from?
Rachel: Um, I spent most of my life in a small??town??in Utah called Spanish Fork actually.
Justin: Oh, um, I just need to lie here.
Rachel: Um, so, where are you from, Justin? I'm going to call the manager.
Justin: No, no, no, no, no! I just need to rest. Oh yeah, I'm from, from, uh, from Spanish Fork.
Rachel: Wait. Are you sure? You're just not thinking right.
Justin: No, no, no. Not Spanish . . . . Ah, No, I'm from Salt Lake City. So,??what do you do for a living? anyway? Are you a body builder or something?
Rachel: No, no. I'm a teacher.
Justin: Oh, so what do you teach?
Rachel: I teach math and science, and it doesn't take a science teacher to tell me that you need a doctor.
Justin: No, I'm okay, I'm okay. I'll stand here in a minute. Uh, could I have your phone number? You know, just in case.
Rachel: I don't think so. I think 911 is the number you need??at this point.
Justin: (<i>Crying in pain</i>) Ohhhh!
