Man: So, what do you want to do tomorrow?
Woman: Well, let's look at this city guide here. [<i>Okay</i>] Uh, here's something interesting. [<i>Oh!</i>]Why don't we first visit the art museum in the morning?
Man: Okay. I like that idea. And where do you want to eat lunch?
Woman: How about going to an Indian restaurant? [<i>Humm</i>] The guide??recommends??one downtown a few??blocks??from the museum.
Man: Now that sounds great. After that, what do you think about visiting the zoo? [<i>Oh . . umm . . well . . .</i>? ] Well, it says here that there are some very unique animals not found anywhere else.
Woman: Well,??to tell you the truth, I'm not really interested in going there. [<i>Really?</i>]. Yeah. Why don't we go shopping instead? There are supposed to be some really nice places to??pick up??souvenirs.
Man: Nah, I don't think that's a good idea. We only have few travelers checks left, and I only have fifty dollars left in cash.
Woman: No problem. We can use YOUR credit card to pay for MY new clothes.
Man: Oh, no. I remember the last time you used MY credit card for YOUR purchases.
Woman: Oh well. Let's take the subway down to the seashore and walk along the beach.
Man: Now that sounds like a wonderful plan.
