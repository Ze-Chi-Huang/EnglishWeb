Carla: So, how are things going, Steve?
Steve: Well, to be honest Carla, I was feeling great on Saturday, but I started to feel sick Sunday afternoon. I thought I'd get better, but I feel worse than before. And I'm really worried because I'm scheduled to give a presentation at work on Friday, so I have to be better by then.
Carla: Well, what seems to be the problem?
Steve: Well, I thought I had??the flu, but the doctor said it was just a bad cold. He gave me some cold medicine to take care of my??stuffy??nose and fever. I'm??supposed??to take the medicine three times a day after eating, but it doesn't??seem??to help. He also told me to??stay off my feet? for a day or so, but I'm so busy these days.
Carla: Listen, forget about that medicine! I have just the thing to? get rid of? Â bad colds. You see, my mom is really into herbal medicine.
Steve: Oh, no thanks.
Carla: Ah,??come on! Give it a try. You just take some of my mom's herbal tea and drink it four times a day. Believe me. You'll be up and dancing around in no time.
Steve: Dancing around in no time, right? Well, I guess. Nothing else seems to be doing the job.
Carla: Great. I'll come by your place at 7:30. See you then.
