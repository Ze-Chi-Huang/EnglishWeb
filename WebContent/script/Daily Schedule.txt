Woman: So, what's your usual day like? You always seem so busy.
Man: Well, I usually get up around 5:00 a.m. and work on the computer until 6:00 a.m.
Woman: Why do you get up so early?
Man: Well, I have to leave home at twenty to seven (6:40 a.m.) so I can??catch? a bus at 7:00 o'clock . It takes me about twenty minutes to walk to the bus stop from my house.
Woman: And what time do you get to work?
Man: Uh, my bus takes about an hour to get there, but it stops right in front of my office.
Woman: That's nice. And what time do you??get off work?
Man: Uh, around 5:00 o'clock. Then, we eat??dinner? around 6:30, and my wife and I read and play with the??kids??until 8:00 or so.
Woman: So, when do you work on your website? You said one time that you create it at home?
Man: Well, my wife and I often watch TV or talk until 10:00 o'clock. She then often reads while I work on my site, and I sometimes??stay up? until the early hours of the morning, but I try to finish everything by one or two.
Woman: And then you get up at 5:00 a.m.?
Man: Well, yeah, but it's important to live a balanced life. I enjoy what I do, but you have to??set aside? time for the family and yourself.
Woman: I agree.
Man: But I think my wife has the??toughest??job. She spends her whole day??taking care of? our family . . . taking the kids to school, working in the garden, buying??groceries, taking the kids to piano lessons . . . [<i>Wow!</i>] It's a full-time job, but she enjoys what she does.
Woman: Well, it sounds like you're a busy, but lucky man.
Man: I think so too.
