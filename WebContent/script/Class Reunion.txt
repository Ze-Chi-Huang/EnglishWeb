Amanda: Hey, I know you. You're James, right? James Roberts.
James: Amanda Brown. Wow! It's been a long time.
Amanda: Yeah. Oh, are you going to the class??reunion??in two weeks?
James: Uh, I heard about it, but I'm not sure. Where is it?
Amanda: The reunion is going to be held at the Mountain Country Club across from City Park.
James: And what time does it start?
Amanda: I think it starts at 6:00.
James: And how much does it cost?
Amanda: It's twenty dollars a ticket, and that includes dinner and entertainment.
James: What kind of entertainment are they going to have?
Amanda: They're going to have a live jazz band and dancing.
James: And who is??organizing??the event?
Amanda: Do you remember Chad Phillips?
James: Uh, wasn't he the quarterback on the football team?
Amanda: Right. Well, he married Sarah Rogers, and they??are in charge? of the event. So, what do you think? Are you going?
James: I don't know. I never really??fit in? in high school. I was kind of a??loner. I also remember asking Sarah out on a date, and she??turned me down. She said she was sick, and it turned out she went out with someone that same night. It could be a little??awkward.
Amanda: Hey, why don't we go together?
James: Are you sure?
Amanda: Yeah.
James: Well, sure. Why not. To be honest, I always thought you were very nice. I just never had the??guts? to ask you out.
Amanda: Well, here's your chance.
James: Sounds great. So, what's your number so I can call you?
Amanda: It's 435-923-6017.
James: 6017, Okay. Where do you live?
Amanda: I only live two blocks south of the old high school.
James: Okay. I remember where you live. Let me call you a few days before to??confirm??things.
Amanda: Sounds good. It should be fun.
