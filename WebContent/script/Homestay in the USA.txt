Brandon: Hey, James. Glad you could??make it. Come on in to the living room.
James: Yeah, uh, thanks for inviting me. As I said, I'm looking for place where I can have a homestay experience and??pick up? some English and culture, and . . . Uh, who is that on your sofa?
Brandon: Oh, that? Ah Randall. Ah, man. He's my roommate.
James: What? How many people live in this house?
Brandon: Well, let's see. There's my American mom and dad, and they have 13 kids. Uh, the family has four dogs, three cats, a rabbit, and a, oh yeah, a large snake named Phil. And then there are three international students that share a room with one of the dogs.
James: No, I don't think this is a good idea. I can't live here.
Brandon: No, man. You'll like it. You and Randall can be??roomies.
James: No. No way. I mean, what is Randall like anyway?
Brandon: Oh, Randall? Ah, he's so??laid-back, and he??gets along with??everyone . . . when he is awake.
James: What?
Brandon: Yeah, he plays video games about, well until about four in the morning, but the noise won't bother you much. Just wear earphones. And he can give you a ride to school . . . uh, when he goes.
James: No, forget it. I'll live with my brother in the??dorms.
