Joshua: Dad. Allowance day. Can I have my allowance?
Father: Oh. I forgot about that.
Joshua: You ALWAYS forget.
Father: I guess I do. How much do I owe you?
Joshua: Just $13.
Father: Thirteen dollars!? Why do I owe you that much? Just seems like I paid you the other day.
Joshua: No. You forget every Saturday, and it has been piling up.
Father: Well, I'm not sure if I have that much.
Joshua: Go to the bank. You have lots of money.
Father: Lots of money, uh? Uh, well, I think the bank is closed.
Joshua: Then, what about your secret money jar under your bed?
Father: Oh, I guess I could do that. So, what are you going to do with the money?
Joshua: I'm going to put some in savings, give some to the poor people, and use the rest to buy books.
Father: Well, that's sounds great, Joshua.
