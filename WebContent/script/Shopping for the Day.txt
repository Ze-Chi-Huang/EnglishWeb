Man: Hi young lady. How may I help you?
Girl: Well, . . . yeah. I'm looking for a Father's Day gift.
Man: Okay. How about getting your father a new wallet?
Girl: Hmm. How much is that wallet?
Man: Huh . . . which one?
Girl: The black one.
Man: Oh. It's only $40.95.
Girl: Huh? That's too expensive for me. Do you have a cheaper one?
Man: Hmm. How about this brown leather one?
Girl: Umm. . . I don't think my father will like the design on the outside, and it doesn't have a place to put pictures. How much is it anyway?
Man: It's $25.99.
Girl: Humm. I don't have that much money.
Man: Okay. How much money do you have to spend?
Girl: I'm not sure [money falling on the table]. Probably about ten dollars or so. I've been helping my mom around the house for the past week to earn some money. This is all I have.
Man: Hmm. How about this tie?
Girl: That's real pretty, but the price tag says $13.99, and I know I don't have that much money.
Man: Well, let's just say the tie went on sale. How about $5.00. What do you say?
Girl: Oh, thanks. I'll take it.
