Carl: Hi. My name's Carl. Nice to meet you.
Pancho: Nice to meet you, too. My name is Francisco.
Carl: What?
Pancho: Francisco, but all my friends and family back in Peru call me Pancho.
Carl: Okay, Pancho. So, tell me about your family?
Pancho: Well, I have seven brothers and six sisters.
Carl: Wow. That is a big family. So are you the oldest, Pancho?
Pancho: No. I'm the second oldest in my family.
Carl: So, what do your parents do?
Pancho: My father is a taxi driver in Lima, Peru. It's a hard job, but he works hard to support the family.
Carl: How about your mother?
Pancho: She helps run a small family store with some of my older brothers and sisters.
Carl: What kind of store?
Pancho: We mainly sell food, like bread, eggs, soft drinks, rice, sugar, and cookies. Things that people buy every day.
