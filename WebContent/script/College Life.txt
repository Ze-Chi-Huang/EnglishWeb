Maria: Oh, hi Dave. Long time, no see!
Dave: Hi Maria. I was in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd drop by.
Maria: Come on in. [Thanks.] Take a seat. Would you like anything to drink? I have Sprite or orange juice.
Dave: Sprite would be fine. Uh, so, how have you been?
Maria: Oh, not bad. And you?
Dave: Oh, I'm doing okay, but school has been really??hectic??these days, and I haven't had time to relax.
Maria: By the way, what's your??major??anyway?
Dave: Hotel management.
Maria: Well, what do you want to do once you graduate?
Dave: Uh... I haven't decided for sure, but I think I'd like to work for a hotel or travel agency in this area. How about you?
Maria: Well, when I first started college, I wanted to major in French, but I realized I might have a hard time finding a job using the language, so I changed majors to computer science. [<em>Oh</em>]. With the right skills,??landing a job? in the computer industry shouldn't be as difficult.
Dave: So, do you have a part-time job to support yourself through school?
Maria: Well, fortunately for me, I received a four-year academic scholarship [<em>Wow</em>] that pays for all of my tuition and books.
Dave: Wow. That's great.
Maria: Yeah. How about you? Are you??working your way through school?
Dave: Yeah. I work three times a week at a restaurant near campus.
Maria: Oh. What do you do there?
Dave: I'm a cook.
Maria: How do you like your job?
Dave: It's okay. The other workers are friendly, and the pay isn't bad.
