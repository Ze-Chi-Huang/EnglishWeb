Man: Hey, Kathy. I'm thinking about renting a movie for tonight's party, and I want to know what kind of movies you like.
Woman: Okay. What kind of movies do you??have in mind?
Man: Well, what about action movies?
Woman: Ah, I don't really like action movies. Too much violence.
Man: Okay, do you like comedies?
Woman: Now, I do enjoy comedies.
Man: Fine. Well, what do you think of horror movies or love stories?
Woman: Uh . . . I'm not really??crazy about? horror movies, but love stories are often fun to watch. Oh, and I really like foreign films, too.
Man: Okay. I'll go to the video store and see what I can find. Thanks.
