Tom: Hi. I don't think we've met. My name's Tom.
Jenny: Hi, Tom. Nice to meet you. My name is Juanita, but everybody calls me Jenny.
Tom: Nice to meet you, Jenny. So, where are you from?
Jenny: Well, originally I'm from Argentina, but we moved to the United States when I was about five years old. My parents now live in Chile. That's where they first met. How about you, Tom?
Tom: I was born in Fresno, California, and we lived there until I was seven. Then, since my father worked for the military, we moved all over the place.
Jenny: Oh yeah? Where are some of the places you've lived?
Tom: Mostly, we were overseas. We spent ten years in Korea, Germany, and Okinawa, Japan, and then, we were transferred back to the States three years ago.
Jenny: Wow. It sounds like you've had an interesting life. So, what do you do now?
Tom: I'm a university student.
Jenny: Oh really? What are you studying?
Tom: I'm majoring in psychology. How about you? What do you do?
Jenny: Well, I'm working as a sales representative for computer company called CompTech downtown.
Tom: No kidding! My brother works there too.
